# React-Based Calculator 🧮

This is my very basic project called **React-Based Calculator**, created as part of my journey to learn and strengthen my understanding of React and Vite for building modern UI interfaces.

## What I've Learned So Far 📝

1. **React Fundamentals**:

   - The behavior of `useState` for managing state in React components.
   - Understanding and utilizing **Props**:
     - Passing data from parent to child components.
     - Passing entire functions as props for better interactivity.

2. **JSX**:

   - Learned what a JSX file is and its importance in React for writing HTML-like syntax within JavaScript.

3. **Styling Techniques**:

   - Using **CSS Modules** for scoped and modular CSS in React components.
   - Learning **Bootstrap** to style and design responsive UI elements.

4. **Tooling with Vite**:
   - Setting up and using **Vite** to create a fast and efficient development environment for React projects.
